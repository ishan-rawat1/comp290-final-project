# AI Music Recommendation App: 6-Month Action Plan

## Overview
This action plan outlines the steps to build the AI Music Recommendation App over the next six months. Each section includes specific goals, tasks, and extra resources to ensure meaningful progress.

---

## Month 1: Weeks 1–3
### Goal:
- **Understand Spotify's API**: Learn how to authenticate users, retrieve data, and work with the Spotify API endpoints effectively.
- **Define Core Features**: Finalize the features to include in my app, focusing on mood-based, activity-based, and user preference-based recommendations.
- **Set Up Project Environment**: Create the basic project structure (frontend, backend, and database), ensuring that I have the tools ready to start development.

### Tasks:
1. Set up a Spotify Developer Account and create an app to obtain client credentials for the API.
2. Explore Spotify's API documentation and test basic API calls (e.g., retrieving user playlists and track features).
3. Draft a feature requirements document and finalize which functionalities to prioritize.
4. Initialize the project in GitHub and set up the folder structure for frontend, backend, and documentation.

## Month 2: Weeks 4–6
### Goal:
- **Learn Machine Learning Basics**: Gain a solid understanding of machine learning concepts needed for recommendation algorithms, focusing on clustering and mood detection.
- **Implement Basic Backend**: Set up the backend to handle Spotify API integration and data retrieval.

### Tasks:
1. Complete tutorials on machine learning basics, focusing on clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) and mood detection using PCA.
2. Build a Flask or Django backend with endpoints to fetch and store user data from Spotify.
3. Design a Figma wireframe that outlines user flows, such as login, data input, and recommendation displays.
4. Test API integration with mock user data and refine data-fetching logic.

## Month 3: Weeks 7–9
### Goal:
- **Build Recommendation Algorithm**: Start creating the basic recommendation logic using clustering or collaborative filtering techniques.
- **Develop Frontend Prototype**: Build a simple user interface that connects to your backend and displays basic recommendations.
- **Test and Debug Core Features**: Ensure smooth communication between the frontend, backend, and Spotify API.

### Tasks:
1. Implement a basic recommendation algorithm using clustering techniques on mock user data.
2. Use React (or React Native) to create a frontend prototype with features like user login, data input, and basic output of recommendations.
3. Integrate the backend API with the frontend for seamless data flow.
4. Debug API calls and algorithm outputs, ensuring accurate data retrieval and processing.

## Month 4: Weeks 10–12
### Goal:
- **Refine Recommendation Algorithm**: Enhance the algorithm by incorporating user preferences, moods, and activity-based inputs.
- **Improve Frontend Design**: Add a polished, intuitive UI to the prototype, including filters for user preferences.
- **Add Authentication Flow**: Implement user authentication using OAuth to allow login with Spotify credentials.

### Tasks:
1. Extend the recommendation algorithm to include mood detection using pre-trained machine learning models like TensorFlow or Hugging Face.
2. Design advanced filters in the UI for user preferences (e.g., mood, tempo, genre).
3. Implement OAuth for user login and permissions for accessing Spotify data.
4. Test the updated recommendation flow end-to-end and gather feedback from friends or peers.

## Month 5: Weeks 13–15
### Goal:
- **Deploy and Host App**: Deploy my app to a platform like Heroku or AWS for public use.
- **Optimize Performance**: Improve the app’s speed and responsiveness by optimizing API calls and UI components.
- **Collect User Feedback**: Share the app with friends or peers for beta testing and collect feedback for improvement.

### Tasks:
1. Deploy the backend using Heroku or AWS Lambda and set up the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
2. Optimize API calls by caching frequently accessed data and reducing unnecessary requests.
3. Share the app’s link with a group of beta testers and document feedback on functionality and user experience.
4. Create a README.md file with deployment instructions and project details.

## Month 6: Weeks 16–18
### Goal:
- **Implement Advanced Features**: Add support for activity-based recommendations using sensors or manual input.
- **Finalize Documentation**: Prepare detailed documentation for the codebase, including setup instructions and API usage.

### Tasks:
1. Add functionality for activity-based recommendations (e.g., integrating data from wearable devices or manual activity input).
2. Write detailed documentation for the project, including a "Getting Started" guide for developers.
3. Conduct a final round of testing and refinement to ensure a bug-free experience.
