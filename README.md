# COMP 290 Final Project Proposal: AI Music Recommendation App

## 1. Type of Project
- **Application Type**: Web app or mobile app.
- **Overview**:  The project will involve developing an AI-powered application designed to recommend songs to users based on a variety of factors, such as their listening history, current mood detected through machine learning algorithms, and even physical activities like running, walking, or resting. The application will integrate with the Spotify API to access user data, which will serve as the foundation for generating personalized music recommendations. In addition, the app will have a unique feature where users can set specific preferences for their recommendations, allowing for deeper customization, such as choosing the genre, tempo, or mood of songs. This customizability ensures that users maintain a degree of control over the generated playlists, making their listening experience more immersive and engaging. The app will include a clean, intuitive user interface where users can easily interact with the different recommendation modes and options, ensuring a seamless experience. Users will have the flexibility to choose between listening history-based suggestions, mood-based selections, and activity-based playlists, providing them with music that best suits their current state or activity. This project will showcase the integration of machine learning, API utilization, and frontend development to create an engaging music recommendation platform.
  
## 2. Motivation
- **Why This Project?**: Music is an integral part of many people’s daily lives, influencing moods, productivity levels, and even physical performance during exercise. The idea of building an AI-powered music recommendation app stems from the desire to make music selection more dynamic and personalized for each individual. By integrating machine learning and Spotify's API, this project will provide a unique take on music streaming, offering recommendations that are tailored to the user's current state or activity. This project will push my understanding of integrating AI with real-world applications and enhance my development skills in a meaningful way. The challenge of combining user experience design, machine learning, and API integration into a cohesive app excites me, as it aligns with my passion for creating innovative and practical software solutions.

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: The target audience for this app primarily consists of music enthusiasts who are always on the lookout for new and exciting music experiences, fitness lovers who rely on the right music to enhance their workout sessions, and anyone who enjoys discovering music that resonates with their current mood or activity. Additionally, this app will cater to individuals who appreciate having a high level of personalization in their music streaming experience.
- **Demographics**: The typical demographic for this app would be users aged between 15 and 40 years. This age group includes high school and college students, working professionals, and even fitness trainers or athletes who frequently listen to music during their workouts. The app will appeal to tech-savvy individuals who enjoy the convenience and features of music streaming apps but wish for more tailored music recommendations that go beyond traditional algorithms.
- **Devices Used**: The app will be developed with mobile-first design principles, focusing on smartphones as the primary device used by most of the target audience. However, the app will also be available as a web app to ensure accessibility from computers and tablets, allowing users to enjoy personalized music recommendations across different devices. This flexibility ensures that users can listen at home, at the gym, or while commuting.

## 4. Problem and Solution
- **Problem Statement**: Traditional music recommendation systems tend to rely heavily on users' past listening data and preferences, without considering the user's present emotional state or physical activities. While these systems can be effective in curating playlists based on long-term preferences, they often fail to deliver recommendations that align with the user’s current mood or activity. This can lead to an unsatisfactory music listening experience where users might have to manually search for songs or playlists that better fit their present context. The lack of real-time personalization can be frustrating, especially for users who use music to motivate themselves during workouts or to unwind after a long day.
- **Solution**: This project proposes the development of an AI-powered app that leverages machine learning algorithms to detect a user's current mood through emotion recognition and analyze physical activities to offer tailored music recommendations. The app will utilize data from the Spotify API to access listening history and preferences, ensuring that recommendations are personalized and relevant. Additionally, users will have the option to input specific preferences, such as choosing a music genre or mood, to receive customized playlists that suit their tastes at any given moment. The integration of machine learning will enable the app to provide contextually relevant suggestions, creating a dynamic music experience that adapts to the user's real-time needs. This approach aims to enhance user satisfaction by delivering music that matches their current state, whether they are working out, relaxing, or studying, ultimately creating a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience.
