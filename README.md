# COMP 290 Final Project Proposal: AI Music Recommendation App

## 1. Type of Project
- **Application Type**: Web app or mobile app.
- **Overview**: The project will involve creating an AI-powered app that recommends songs to users by analyzing their listening history, current mood (using emotion detection), or physical activities. It will be connected to Spotify's API for user data and provide highly personalized music suggestions. Additionally, the app will include a customizable recommendation algorithm that lets users select specific preferences.

## 2. Motivation
- **Why This Project?**: Music is an integral part of many people's daily routines, and a personalized recommendation system can enhance user experience. This project aims to provide a more dynamic and relevant music selection that adapts to the user’s mood and activity, offering more personalized suggestions.
- **Personal Interest**: This project combines my interests in machine learning, software development, and practical applications. It will challenge my understanding of AI integration in real-world software, benefiting my skillset and software engineering portfolio.

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Music enthusiasts, fitness lovers, and anyone interested in discovering music that matches their current state.
- **Demographics**: Users aged 15-40, including students, professionals, and casual listeners.
- **Devices Used**: Smartphones, tablets, and personal computers.

## 4. Problem and Solution
- **Problem Statement**: Existing music recommendation systems mainly rely on historical data and fail to consider the user’s current mood or activities.
- **Solution**: This AI-powered app will use machine learning to detect the user's mood and analyze physical activity to offer personalized music suggestions. Users can also input preferences to tailor their recommendations further.
- **Benefits**: This approach ensures a more engaging listening experience, adapting music suggestions based on real-time factors and user preferences.
